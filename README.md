# C is for Coffee - A Network Chuck Inspired Project

Copied what Network Chuck did in his [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTqu6w2wc68&ab_channel=NetworkChuck)... because I like coffee too!

Another simple little Clang program that prints out a message to the console. This time, it's about coffee!

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo
3. Run the following commands:
```bash 
clang coffee.c -o coffee
./coffee
```

## Sample Output
```bash
I've had 20 coffees today! (c to increment)
I've had 7 servings of water today! (h to increment)
I've had 1 bowls of oatmeal today! (o to increment)
I've had 5 walks today! (w to increment)
I've had 21 pushups today! (p to increment)
I've had 8 stretches today! (s to increment)
```
